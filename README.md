# ATM-Exercise
ATM Exercise
This is a React exercise that allows a user to deposit and withdraw from a fictional bank account. 
Improvements made from the starter code are the refactoring exercises that were assigned in the NextTech assignment for the course. This included a submit button that doesn't activate if the withdrawal amount is more than the account balance.
